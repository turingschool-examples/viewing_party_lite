# Viewing Party

This is the base repo for the [Viewing Party Lite project](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/viewing_party_lite) used for Turing's Backend Module 3.

### About this Project

Viewing Part Lite is an application in which users can explore movie options and create a viewing party event for themselves and other users of the application.

## Setup for the use of the project

1. A conveyor belt link will be sent out at project kickoff so that you can both fork and copy the project board on this base repo. 

## Local Setup for any other use

1. Fork and Clone the repo
2. Install gem packages: `bundle install`
3. Setup the database: `rails db:create`


## Wins
- We were able to implement the necessary API calls and get the data we needed to display on the page
- We successfully implemented gems like Figaro, VCR, Webmock, and Faraday
- Our code is logically organized and easy to read

## Challenges
- We had trouble getting VCR to work initially, but we were eventually able to get it working
- There was some confusion about what routes were necessary to implement
- The user stories were a little vague, so we had to make some assumptions about what was needed which took time away from other goals

## Versions

- Ruby 2.7.2
- Rails 5.2.6
