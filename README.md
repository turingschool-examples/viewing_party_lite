On your local system, open a terminal session to run the following commands:
1. Clone this repository:`git@github.com:wanderlust-create/viewing_party_lite.git`
3. Navigate to the newly cloned directory:`cd viewing_party_lite`
4. If bundler is not installed run:`gem install bundler`
5. To install the required Gems run:`bundle install`
6. If errors occur, check for proper installation and versions of:`bundler`, `ruby`, and `rails`
7. Add file to store your unique API keys:`touch config/application.yml`, `atom config/application.yml'
8. Add your unique API keys to the `/config/application.yml` file as follows:<br>
```
api_key: your unique TMDB API key 

```
9. Set up the database locally with:`rails db:{drop, create, migrate }`
10. Open your text editor and check to see that `schema.rb` was created.
11. You may also run the RSpec test suite locally with the command `bundle exec rspec` to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
