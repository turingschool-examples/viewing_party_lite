## Database Schema

This app uses a many-to-many relational database: Users have many Invitations, and many Parties through Invitations. Parties have many Invitations, and many Users through Invitations. Invitations belong to a User and a Party. Movie data are displayed using a Movie PORO Class, objects of which are generated through the MovieService and MovieFacade classes.
