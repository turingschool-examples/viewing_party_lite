        as America''s biggest box-office draw to his later years as a controversial
        conservative icon. Examined closely, Wayne''s life is a startling series of
        contradictions. He was a member of his high school''s Shakespeare club who
        began his career by acting in scores of B-grade Westerns, and though he avoided
        military service, he was considered an American hero. Filled with well-chosen
        archival stills, as well as seldom-seen early clips, this video also features
        interviews with fellow actors Charlton Heston and Ron Howard, as well as writer
        and scholar Garry Wills (author of a brilliant intellectual study of Wayne''s
        work and life, John Wayne''s America).","popularity":0.693,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"1998-03-14","title":"JOHN
