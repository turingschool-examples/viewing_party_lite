        Hill''s undervalued neo-noir.\r\n\r\nJohnny Handsome is directed by Walter
        Hill and adapted to screenplay by Ken Friedman from the novel \"The Three
        Worlds of Johnny Handsome\" written by John Godey. It stars Mickey Rourke,
        Ellen Barkin, Elizabeth McGovern, Lance Henriksen, Forest Whitaker, Morgan
        Freeman and Scott Wilson. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Matthew
        F. Leonetti.\r\n\r\nJohn Sedley (Rourke), AKA: Johnny Handsome, has a severely
        disfigured face, when he and his only real friend are double-crossed by two
        accomplices during a robbery, Johnny is sent to prison and his life reaches
        a new low. However, hope springs in the form of Dr. Steven Fisher (Whitaker),
        a pioneering plastic surgeon who offers to give Johnny surgery that would
        give him a normal face as he attempts to integrate back into society. With
        a new face making him unrecognisable, there is scope to enact revenge on the
        two people who killed his best friend and had him put in prison...\r\n\r\nWalter
        Hill knows his film noir, anyone who has seen The Driver knows this. Here
        for Johnny Handsome, Hill takes a lot of the fantastical elements of noir
        and dresses it up admirably as a violent revenge thriller. A box office flop
        and something of a kicking post for big hitting critics of the late 1980s,
        it''s a film that now can be seen as being very much in tune with its influences.\r\n\r\nThe
        charges of it being too bonkers, too violent and too much of a \"B\" movie
        homage just don''t add up, because what is on offer is good solid meaty neo-noir
        cinema. A protagonist with an affliction, medical shenanigans, hyper femme
        fatale, over the top villain and a stoic and sarcastic gumshoe type copper.
        All of which operate in a sweaty and luridly coloured New Orleans. Add in
        Hill''s eye for aggressive action sequences and it''s neo a go-go.\r\n\r\nHill
        gets strong performances from his cast, ensuring emotional bonds are not over
        egged and a clamour for sympathy and understanding kept to a bearable level
        by the actors playing the \"good\" guys \"n\" dolls. While giving Henriksen
        and Barkin licence to sizzle with sinister glee is astute and perfectly in
        tune with the material on the page. Leonetti''s photography has the requisite
        pulpy noirishness to it, and the familiar twangs of Ry Cooder are never a
        bad thing in a Walter Hill movie.\r\n\r\nIt''s not perfect by any stretch
        of the imagination, but those complaining about missed opportunities regarding
        rehabilitation - or that the liberal doctor turns out to be clinically wrong
        in his reform beliefs - really are missing the point or unaware of the world
        where something like Johnny Handsome lives. From the kinetic misery at film''s
        start, to the \"ever so in tune with film noir\" finale, Johnny Handsome is
        well worth a look by anyone interested in noir''s updated version. 7/10","created_at":"2014-03-31T07:21:33.197Z","id":"5339177d9251417d9e003ee0","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:25.504Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5339177d9251417d9e003ee0"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}'
