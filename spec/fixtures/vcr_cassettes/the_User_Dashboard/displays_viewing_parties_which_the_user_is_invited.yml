        Godfather Review by Al Carlson\r\n\r\nThe Godfather is a film considered by
        most to be one of the greatest ever made. From The American Film Institute
        to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider
        to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces
        including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an
        exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the
        pinnacle crime drama.\r\nThe Godfather revolves around the Corleone’s, an
        Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the
        Corleone’s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands
        respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World
        War II, doesn’t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo’s,
        a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange
        for profits from the Sollozzo’s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for
        he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into
        an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into
        the mafia lifestyle.\r\nThe characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star
        cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James
        Caan as Don’s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered
        by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances.
        All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon
        Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It’s fascinating to
        watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in
        particular changing drastically.\r\nDirecter Francis Ford Coppola, being raised
        in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally
        and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to
        the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola’s
        first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota
        did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting
        the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel,
        The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet
        solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian
        film 8 1/2. \r\nThis film should be immediately followed up by it’s sequel,
        The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds
        the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They’re
        both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best
        pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won’t be able to see this film
        only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing
        more to add other than if you haven’t seen this movie yet, it’s about time
        you did. The Godfather is a movie you can’t refuse.","created_at":"2014-04-10T20:09:40.500Z","id":"5346fa840e0a265ffa001e20","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:25.895Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5346fa840e0a265ffa001e20"},{"author":"crastana","author_details":{"name":"","username":"crastana","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87b1f10dd7dae245ac84657537983336.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"The
