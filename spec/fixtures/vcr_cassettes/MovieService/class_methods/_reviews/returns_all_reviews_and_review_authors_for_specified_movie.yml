        very entertaining ending makes this film.\r\n\r\nI wasn''t sure about <em>''Lock,
        Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''</em> up until that point. Like, don''t get
        me wrong, it is a good film from the get-go but I wasn''t personally convinced
        by it to be more than that until the credits rolled - at which point, I found
        myself to have been thoroughly entertained.\r\n\r\nWith Guy Ritchie in his
        directing debut and a whole host of familiar British faces, it isn''t a difficult
        film to get into. I did feel at some points that there were too many characters
        and that they weren''t distinctive enough; there were momentary bits where
        I had to think a tad harder at which characters were linked with each other.
        However, that actually turns into the film''s best thing at the end as it
        does come together brilliantly.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this 1998 gangster flick
        is something I''d consider as very good and worthy of watching.","created_at":"2022-03-16T01:38:40.389Z","id":"62313fa06517d60045ed073a","updated_at":"2022-03-16T01:38:40.389Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62313fa06517d60045ed073a"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":4}'
