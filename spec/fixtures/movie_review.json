Michelle Yeoh leads the troops in a film that also pays homage to the iconic career of the actress who, at 59 years old, accompanies the fantastic stunt team in truly outlandish fights.\r\n\r\nThe mother-daughter relationship as the emotional core of the story follows a surprisingly predictable path and needs a few more dialogues to deliver an even more powerful climax, but it still induces tears and a genuine sense of concern for the characters.\r\n\r\nTechnically, all the elements are so creatively unique that it warrants the clickbait \"you've never seen anything like this\".\r\n\r\nSee it in theaters!\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",
